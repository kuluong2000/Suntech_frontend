						CSS is sadly an increasingly undervalued tool for front end developers, in no small part because developers find debugging CSS challenging. Yet, until now there's been little in depth published on debugging CSS. Ahmad Shadeed's book is long overdue, and I can't recommend it highly enough for any front end developer.
